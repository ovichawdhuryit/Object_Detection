Babar_DorBar – AI-Powered Microwave Cooking Assistant

Babar_DorBar is an intelligent cooking assistant that detects food using a webcam, generates microwave cooking instructions via LLaMA-3.1, and communicates with an Arduino-controlled microwave system to automatically set temperature and cooking time. The system also provides real-time feedback on an LCD display.
